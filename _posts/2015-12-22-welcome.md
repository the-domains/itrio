# Welcome

We are thrilled to announce our CD release party on the 30th of March at the Mahogany Hall in Bern!!!!  
Thursday 30th of March, 20:00, www.mahogany.ch !

We had the honor to record it during our one week stay at The [Maison des Artistes in Chamonix][0]. We just mixed it at Benoit Piccand's studio in Biel ([facebook video][1]) : sounds terrific !!!

Lately we played in quite a few great places like Neuch√¢tel and Vilnius for the [Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival][2]. Our CD release tour is on its way, check our "[contact and tour dates][3]" section for more infos.  
BTW, by scrolling down a bit, you'll find some pictures from our gigs and more. It updates all the time, come back!
