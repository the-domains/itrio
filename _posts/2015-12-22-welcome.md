Our new album is on it's way and will arrive at the end of March 2017\. Stay tuned!

We had the honor to record it during our one week stay at The [Maison des Artistes in Chamonix][0]. We just mixed it at Benoit Piccand's studio in Biel ([facebook video][1]) : sounds terrific !!!

Our last gigs were be in Neuch√¢tel and Vilnius for the [Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival][2]. Check our "[contact and tour dates][3]" section for more infos.
