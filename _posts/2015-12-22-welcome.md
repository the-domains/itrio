# Welcome

Our new album "Around The World" is just out... yeah!!!!!

You can check it out on every major platform or on our [bandcamp][0].

We had the honor to record it during our one week stay at The [Maison des Artistes in Chamonix][1]. We just mixed it at Benoit Piccand's studio in Biel ([facebook video][2]) : sounds terrific !!!

Lately we played in quite a few great places like Neuchâtel and Vilnius for the [Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival][3]. Our CD release tour is on its way, check our "[contact and tour dates][4]" section for more infos.  
BTW, by scrolling down a bit, you'll find some pictures from our gigs and more. It updates all the time, come back!
