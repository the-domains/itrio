# Welcome

Our new album is on it's way and will arrive at the end of March 2017\. Stay tuned!

We had the honor to record it during our one week stay at The [Maison des Artistes in Chamonix][0]. We just mixed it at Benoit Piccand's studio in Biel ([facebook video][1]) : sounds terrific !!!

Lately we played in quite a few great places like Neuch√¢tel and Vilnius for the [Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival][2]. Our CD release tour is on its way, check our "[contact and tour dates][3]" section for more infos.  
BTW, by scrolling down a bit, you'll find some pictures from our gigs and more. It updates all the time, come back!
