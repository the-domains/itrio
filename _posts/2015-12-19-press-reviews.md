# Press reviews

> I.Trio,
> Triosom: Jazz-rock threesome from Europe led by guitarist Jan TrÃ¶sch, who dares
> to ask the musical question "Can one shred tastefully?" Answer is, against all
> odds, kinda yes. Strange time signatures here and there but mostly spicy fusion
> with neo-feedbacky and overdriven computer noise touches. Very reminiscent of
> Pat Metheny Trio stuff except with a couple different variations like "let's
> weird things up with synths" ("Triosom" itself) and "let's sound as much like
> African guitar groovemeisters as we can" ("Istanbul"). Very enjoyable, grows on
> me every new listen like a fungus, might be some kind of genius hiding there in
> Switzerland.
