# The band

i.trio: Three unique musicians got together. The sources of this inspired trio are the compositions of the founder, the guitar player Jan Trösch. Fresh guitar sounds, complex harmonic and rhythmic ideas are his feature. The Band never only acts either kind or noisy. This trio understands how to express a wide range of musical moods. The stylistic bandwidth reaches from soft and moony sounds until sharp and expressive ideas. The bassist Pierre Sottas contributes his solid rhythmic feeling along with his characteristic improvisation skills. The drummer, Urs Wittwer, provides a rhythmic and colorful base for the band. All these components result in a thaw of Rock- World- and Jazz music. A musical journey, hard to categorize. This trio definitely found an own voice to the present time.
