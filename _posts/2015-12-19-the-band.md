# The band
![iTrio - the band](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/00bbcc258ca325c054abee1c257b5824050001b0.jpg)

iTrio : Three unique
musicians got together. The sources of this inspired trio are the compositions
of the founder, the guitar player Jan Trösch. Fresh guitar sounds, complex
harmonic and rhythmic ideas are his feature. The Band never only acts either
kind or noisy. This trio understands how to express a wide range of musical
moods. The stylistic bandwidth reaches from soft and moony sounds until sharp
and expressive ideas. The bassist Pierre Sottas contributes his solid rhythmic
feeling along with his characteristic improvisation skills. The drummer, Urs
Wittwer, provides a rhythmic and colorful base for the band. All these
components result in a thaw of Rock-World- and Jazz music. A musical journey,
hard to categorize. This trio definitely found an own voice to the present time. ![Jan Trösch - guitar](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3eeca8660757cf080ab1d6d16a17514fd467103e.jpg)
