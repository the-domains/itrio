  iTrio : Three unique musicians got together. The sources of this inspired trio
  are the compositions of the founder, the guitar player Jan Trösch. Fresh
  guitar sounds, complex harmonic and rhythmic ideas are his feature. The Band
  never only acts either kind or noisy. This trio understands how to express a
  wide range of musical moods. The stylistic bandwidth reaches from soft and
  moony sounds until sharp and expressive ideas. The bassist Pierre Sottas
  contributes his solid rhythmic feeling along with his characteristic
  improvisation skills. The drummer, Urs Wittwer, provides a rhythmic and
  colorful base for the band. All these components result in a thaw of
  Rock-World- and Jazz music. A musical journey, hard to categorize. This trio
  definitely found an own voice to the present time.
